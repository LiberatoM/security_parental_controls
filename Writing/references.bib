title = "TRANCO: A Research-Oriented Top Sites Ranking Hardened Against Manipulation",
abstract = "In order to evaluate the prevalence of security and privacy practices on a representative sample of the Web, researchers rely on website popularity rankings such as the Alexa list. While the validity and representativeness of these rankings are rarely questioned, our findings show the contrary: we show for four main rankings how their inherent properties (similarity, stability, representativeness, responsiveness and benignness) affect their composition and therefore potentially skew the conclusions made in studies. Moreover, we find that it is trivial for an adversary to manipulate the composition of these lists. We are the first to empirically validate that the ranks of domains in each of the lists are easily altered, in the case of Alexa through as little as a single HTTP request. This allows adversaries to manipulate rankings on a large scale and insert malicious domains into whitelists or bend the outcome of research studies to their will. To overcome the limitations of such rankings, we propose improvements to reduce the fluctuations in list composition and guarantee better defenses against manipulation. To allow the research community to work with reliable and reproducible rankings, we provide TRANCO, an improved ranking that we offer through an online service available at https://tranco-list.eu.

	abstract = {Parental control apps, which are mobile apps that allow parents to monitor and restrict their children's activities online, are becoming increasingly adopted by parents as a means of safeguarding their children's online safety. However, it is not clear whether these apps are always beneficial or effective in what they aim to do; for instance, the overuse of restriction and surveillance has been found to undermine parent-child relationship and children's sense of autonomy. While previous research has categorised and taken inventory of key features of popular parental control apps, they have not systematically analysed the ways such features were designed or realised in such apps, or in particular how aspects of such designs might relate to parents and children's experiences with such apps. In this work, we investigate this gap, asking specifically: how might children's and parents' perceptions be related to how parental control features were designed? To investigate this question, we conducted an analysis of 58 top Android parental control apps designed for the purpose of promoting children's online safety, finding three major axes of variation in how key restriction and monitoring features were realised: granularity, feedback/transparency, and parent-child communications support. To relate these axes to perceived benefits and problems, we then analysed 3264 app reviews to identify references to aspects of the each of the axes above, to understand children's and parents' views of how such dimensions related to their experiences with these apps. Our findings led towards 1) an understanding of how parental control apps realise their functionalities differently along three axes of variation, 2) an analysis of exactly the ways that such variation influences children's and parents' perceptions, respectively of the usefulness or effectiveness of these apps, and finally 3) an identification of design recommendations and opportunities for future apps by contextualising our findings within existing digital parenting theories.},

This problem has motivated the academia and industry to develop parental control tools for web content filtering. A few studies demonstrate the significance of research in cyber parental control. However, there is a lack of studies on the methods, techniques, and datasets of this domain. The aim of this study is to present a preliminary study of the methods, techniques, and datasets of the field of cyber parental control. It also identifies the most effective methods and techniques, their strengths and limitations, determine the currently used datasets, and provides insights for the future work on the research of cyber parental control. Addressing such aspects of this field provide a better understanding of the methods, techniques, and dataset in this field not previously fully evaluated. Finally, this study presented several suggestions for proposing an effective and efficient system of cyber parental control.},

Most countries heavily rely on online platforms for education, granting children more freedom to explore the internet using electronic devices. Yet, it is challenging for parents to monitor their online activities. Children may stumble upon unsuitable content such as pornography or get redirected to harmful websites through pop-up advertising. To address these concerns, this study proposes PiWall, a home traffic controller. PiWall aims to block undesirable websites and filter out advertisements to help parents manage their home network. Testing shows that PiWall significantly improves the internet browsing experience by reducing website loading times and network traffic, hence offering protection against inappropriate content and malicious attacks. Implementing PiWall as a home traffic controller is a viable alternative to traditional parental controls in creating a safer internet environment for children.},

Usually, digital parental control methods function by disclosing the entire log of child's on-line activities to their parents, and therefore, these methods do not consider the privacy of the child. Moreover, not all children are under protection, as not all parents provide this service for their children. In this paper, we propose a privacy preserving parental control protocol with edge computing that uses Artificial Intelligence techniques to automatically detect harmful content for minors in 5G networks. Moreover, our protocol provides protection for all children, regardless of whether they have parents who pay for this extra service. Artificial Intelligence makes it possible to classify digital content automatically and also in real time. In order to make our protocol privacy preserving, we use multi-party Private Set Operation protocols.},

While greatly bringing up convenience for children's lives and studies, these Apps also make illegal and inappropriate contents (such as violence, pornography, gambling, and drug) more accessible to kids, which is harmful to minors' growth. To keep children away from inappropriate contents in applications, previous researches mainly focused on detecting unsuitable videos and advertisements in children applications or designing App maturity rating methods and parental control software. There are few literature that specially investigate the inspection of inappropriate contents in children Android Apps. Toward this end, we propose a novel automatic content inspection and the forensics framework to identify children Android Apps which are not proper for kids under 12. In addition, this framework offers evidence to make users understand why the inspected App is judged as unsuitable. In experiments, we apply this framework on some specially chosen Android Apps which distinctly include inappropriate contents to verify its performance. The results show that it can successfully identify those applications with high precision that reaches 85.7\%. Besides, by analyzing the collected children's Android Apps through our framework, we find that 40\% of them are identified to be improper, which illustrates the serious issue of unsuitable children Android Apps.},

	abstract = {Today, with the development of technology, many possibilities are offered to users; however, these possibilities bring along some risks and threats. It is very important to ensure that users, especially teenagers, can benefit from the possibilities of technology at the highest level by minimizing the existing risks. At this point, the roles, attitudes and behaviors of parents have an important effect. The purpose of this study is to reveal the attitudes, behaviors, controls and limitations of middle school students' parents towards their children's use of information technologies. For this purpose, data were collected from parents through survey and interviews. The participants of the study consisted of 354 parents of 6th and 7th grade students from seven public schools and four private schools. The parents filled out a questionnaire. Also, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 13 volunteer parents. According to the results, parents ‘attitudes towards their children's ICT use were positive and they especially supported their use of ICT for educational purposes. However, it was revealed that parents were concerned about the possible risks and security threats that their children may encounter in virtual environments, and therefore they take precaution in order to prevent their children from possible risks by informing, controlling and limiting their children. Based on the results, while children benefit from digital opportunities, they need to prevent themselves from digital risks as well through precautions and interventions with the support of school-parent cooperation.},

	abstract = {The emergence of the Internet and social media has provided a ground conducive to the rapid development of violent ideas and online malicious behavior, and even to rising the share of hostile content (hate speech, fake news, etc.). Such behavior raises concerns about children who are overly exposed to the internet and likely misusing the online content. Unwantedly, they can stumble upon dangerous websites inciting them to violence, terrorism and radicalization. Motivated by the efforts towards confronting these malicious activities, we propose a new parental control application, called ChildProtect. The main purpose of our application is to monitor children’s activities on the Internet, protect them from hostile postings and online threats, prevent the radicalization, and eventually alert and inform their parents. Hence, we introduce a framework composed of two main sides, namely backend and frontend. The frontend presents the Childprotect’s functionalities offered to parents. Unnecessary, the backend constitutes the application’ kernel, which aims at performing a deep content-analysis of the online child’s activities. In this side, we distinguished various steps, including the collecting and managing of the child’s browsing history, as well as mining and analyzing the collected data for identifying its hostile valence. We build a dictionary containing dangerous vocabulary frequently used for online hostility. The findings of our proposed method were evaluated using expert identification. The conducted experiments demonstrated that our method is effective, consistent, and outperforms the results of its competitors in the literature.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, children are more comfortable using online tools for their education. This is also enhanced during the COVID-19 period when one must do online activities such as calls, studies, and meetings. Children who use the Internet regularly, especially in the age group between 6 and 14, may experience Internet risk. While on the Internet, children can fall victim to hateful, age-inappropriate content, cyberbullying, phishing, etc. There are also risks of privacy violations by the websites which can be done through cookies or user account browsing features. Further, excessive use of the Internet may negatively impact a developing child’s physique, cause sleeping problems, and potentially lead to addiction. To protect their children, some parents use Android applications such as Google Family Link (Free), Kids Place Parental Control (free and paid), Norton Family (paid), Qustodio (paid), and FamiSafe (paid). These applications allow the parents to restrict and monitor the child’s behavior. However, many features are not implemented in free applications such as monitoring calls, messages, social media, etc. This research aims to analyze the Google Play Store reviews (positive and negative) of popular and mentioned Android applications and their various features. Based on the research, a free alternative in the form of an application was developed. It has two components—an Android application for the child’s device and a web interface for the parent. This tool allows parents to monitor calls, contacts, and SMS.},

	abstract = {The explosive growth of the amount of information on Internet has made Web page classification essential for Web information management, retrieval, and integration, Web page indexing, topic-specific Web crawling, topic-specific information extraction models, advertisement removal, filtering out unwanted, futile, or harmful contents, and parental control systems. Owing to the recent staggering growth of performance and memory space in computing machines, along with specialization of machine learning models for text and image classification, many researchers have begun to target the Web page classification problem. Yet, automatic Web page classification remains at its early stages because of its complexity, diversity of Web pages’ contents (images of different sizes, text, hyperlinks, etc.), and its computational cost. This paper not only surveys the proposed methodologies in the literature, but also traces their evolution and portrays different perspectives toward this problem. Our study investigates the following: (a) metadata and contextual information surrounding the terms are mostly ignored in textual content classification, (b) the structure and distribution of text in HTML tags and hyperlinks are understudied in textual content classification, (c) measuring the effectives of features in distinguishing among Web page classes or measuring the contribution of each feature in the classification accuracy is a prominent research gap, (d) image classification methods rely heavily on computationally intensive and problem-specific analyses for feature extraction, (e) semi-supervised learning is understudied, despite its importance in Web page classification because of the massive amount of unlabeled Web pages and the high cost of labeling, (f) deep learning, convolutional and recurrent networks, and reinforcement learning remain underexplored but intriguing for Web page classification, and last but not least (g) developing a detailed testbed along with evaluation metrics and establishing standard benchmarks remain a gap in assessing Web page classifiers.},

	abstract = {DNS filtering is the practice of blocking access to certain sites for a specific purpose, often content-based filtering. Unlike previous studies that focused on the behavior of national-level DNS filtering itself (e.g., location of filtering devices), we demonstrate and evaluate in depth the impact of DNS filtering on different types (public, ISP, and open) of DNS resolvers in the censored networks. In particular, we actively send DNS queries for 83 well-selected domain names to three types of DNS resolvers and keep track of the resolvers’ responses changing over time and space in China. Here, we present the results of our system running for 40 days, during which we obtained a total of 1.7 billion DNS records. Using these collected data, we found that specific DNS resolvers are unaffected by DNS filtering devices and can respond with the correct IP addresses for particular blocked domains. Furthermore, we revealed that three factors should be considered to evaluate the impact of a country-level DNS filtering mechanism: DNS resolver, client location, and blocked domain. Finally, we propose and implement a system to identify the correct IP addresses of blocked domain names in censored networks based on the characteristics of country-level DNS filtering.},

abstract = {Blocklists, consisting of known malicious IP addresses, can be used as a simple method to block malicious traffic. However, blocklists can potentially lead to unjust blocking of legitimate users due to IP address reuse, where more users could be blocked than intended. IP addresses can be reused either at the same time (Network Address Translation) or over time (dynamic addressing). We propose two new techniques to identify reused addresses. We built a crawler using the BitTorrent Distributed Hash Table to detect NATed addresses and use the RIPE Atlas measurement logs to detect dynamically allocated address spaces. We then analyze 151 publicly available IPv4 blocklists to show the implications of reused addresses and find that 53-60\% of blocklists contain reused addresses having about 30.6K-45.1K listings of reused addresses. We also find that reused addresses can potentially affect as many as 78 legitimate users for as many as 44 days.},
