\section{Results}
\subsection{Detection}
How does the technique perform in detection? Does it have FPs? Does it have FNs?
How does it compare to iGreedy and MAnycast2.

\subsection{Enumeration}
How many sites can be discovered with the traceroute technique?
What does the distribution look like?
How does this compare to iGreedy results?
What about ground truth (using e.g., CHAOS records, public info, operator GT).

\subsection{Geolocation}
Similar to above.

How close does traceroute get to the real location?
Does it get closer than iGreedy?

\subsection{Locations}
We could write about the locations found.
For example, where are anycast operators often located?
Where are anycast operators often not located?
Do we see different deployment strategies by operators?
How many sites do we find on average?

% where are sites hosted?
Traceroute results may also reveal where the PoPs are hosted. E.g., are they hosted by Vultr? Or Equinix?
Mapping AS diversity of anycast prefixes is an interesting analysis.
Also gives data on upstreams of anycast prefixes.

\subsection{MAnycast2 FPs}
I suspect this will shed light on the MAnycast2 FPs.
These are mostly Microsoft prefixes that are announced globally, but route to unicast servers.
Traceroute will reveal this, and we can further investigate or write it as future work to map this TE practice by global ASes.
