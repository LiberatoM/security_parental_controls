\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}
\subsection{Future work}
This would discuss future work.
In particular, using traceroute to look at anti-DDoS announcements, global BGP (e.g., enumerating ingress PoPs for large global ASes), running this using historical traceroute data, ...

\subsection{How does traceroute perform?}
Then we would discuss the results. I expect it to outperform iGreedy for some prefixes but be 'useless' for others.

We would also discuss the large number of probes needed to do traceroute and if the additional probes are worth the increased coverage.
