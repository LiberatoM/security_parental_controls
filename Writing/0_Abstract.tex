Parental control systems are commonly marketed as tools to protect children from harmful online content. 
However, these systems also claim to offer protection from security threats, a claim we want to test. 
In this work, we evaluate the security filtering capabilities of seven parental control tools: Three consumer routers with built-in filtering (TP-Link, Netgear, ASUS), two DNS-based solutions (OpenDNS FamilyShield, DNS.eu Kids), and a software solutions (Norton Family). 
Using five well-known threat intelligence sources â€” PhishTank, Phishing Army, Spamhaus DBL, URLhaus, and QuidsUp.
We test whether each system blocks or allows known malicious domains.
